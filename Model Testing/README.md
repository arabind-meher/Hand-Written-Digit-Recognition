# MNIST Dataset
In this section, we are going to compare three different Machine Learning classifier techniques using MNIST dataset.

### Decision Tree
The decision tree classifier creates the classification model by building a decision tree. Each node in the tree specifies a test on an attribute, each branch descending from that node corresponds to one of the possible values for that attribute.

### Random Forest
Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.

### k-Nearest Neighbour
k-Nearest Neighbor is a lazy learning algorithm which stores all instances correspond to training data points in n-dimensional space. When an unknown discrete data is received, it analyzes the closest k number of instances saved (nearest neighbors)and returns the most common class as the prediction and for real-valued data it returns the mean of k nearest neighbors.
